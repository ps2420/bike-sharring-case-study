# Bike Sharing Case Study
> Repository contains analysis of a US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes. which has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They would like to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Moreover, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- Repository contains the jypter notebook and some useful insights about the case study described in pdf.
- The jypter note book explains the relation ship between different variables and summarizes the keysteps required for model building

## Conclusions
- Temperature, year & weater situation affects the bike demand most
- Season: Season 3 has highest demand for rental bikes
- Year: Bike sharing demand grows next year.
- Month: Bike demand grows until June, drops in July, august and again increases in sept & oct, followed by a drop in last quarter. 
- Holiday: In holiday period demand increases
- Weekday & working day: It has almost no impact on bike sharing
- Weather: The weathersit 1(Good) has highest demand followed by 2 (Moderate) & 3 (Bad)


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.2.1, Panda, Seaborn, Matplot lib, sklearn & statsmodel
- All the version of softwares were installed as part of Anaconda package, which packages most of the libraries used for Data Science.

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
